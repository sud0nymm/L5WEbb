Reznor has served as the main producer, singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, and sole member of Nine Inch Nails for 28 years. This changed in December 2016 when Atticus Ross officially became the second member of the band. Nine Inch Nails straddles a wide range of many styles of rock music and other genres that require an electronic sound, which can often cause drastic changes in sound from album to album. However NIN albums in general have many identifiable characteristics in common, such as recurring leitmotifs, chromatic melodies, dissonance, terraced dynamics and common lyrical themes. Nine Inch Nails is most famously known for the melding of industrial elements with pop sensibilities in their first albums. This move was considered instrumental in bringing the industrial genre as a whole into the mainstream, although genre purists and Trent Reznor alike have refused to identify NIN as an industrial band.","nameVariations":["9 Inch Nails","Mine Inch Nails","N.I.N.","NIN","NIN Nails","NiN","Nin","Nine Inch Nails.Live","Nine Inch Niles","Nini Inch Nails","The 9\" Nails","The Nine Inch Nails","ナイン・インチ・ネイルズ"],"aliases":[{"alias_id":10108984,"name":"Taxi Driver (10)"}],"memberInGroups":null,"referenceUrls":["http://www.nin.com","http://www.facebook.com/ninofficial","http://instagram.com/nineinchnails","http://myspace.com/nin","http://soundcloud.com/nineinchnails","http://nineinchnails.tumblr.com","http://twitter.com/nineinchnails","http://vimeo.com/ninofficial","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails","http://www.youtube.com/user/ninofficial","http://www.tiktok.com/@nineinchnails"]},

        {"_id":10343,"discogsUrl":"https://www.discogs.com/artist/10343-Tangerine-Dream","name":"Tangerine Dream","realname":null,"description":"Founded by the late Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream is perhaps the premier exponent of \"electronic rock\" music of the \"Berlin School\". From their \"free-rock\" beginnings in the nascent \"krautrock\" scene to the eventual synthesizer-based trio which signed to Virgin, this German group can take significant credit in introducing synthesizer- and sequencer-based electronic music to most of the Western rock world. At the height of their success - during the mid to late 1970s - TD's spacey, pulsing music earned them a tenacious cult following. By the late Seventies, however, line-ups, and more importantly, the formula changed, tilting towards more conventional \"rock\" music. By the early 1980s, TD was primarily releasing influential  soundtrack work, before settling into New Age content by mid-decade.\r\n\r\nFormed in Berlin in 1967, the initial line up (on their first release Electronic Meditation) included Edgar Froese, Conrad Schnitzler (cello) and Klaus Schulze (drums). Their compositions, or rather experimental improvisations, had roots in the psychedelia of London albeit with the \"krautrock\" twist. Electronic Meditation is perhaps a misnomer; traditional instrumentation of organ, drums, guitar, cello, flute were hardly electronic and \"freak out jamming\" is the more appropriate adjective, reflecting the confluence of Twentieth Century avant-garde music. Both Schnitzler and Schulze would depart after this album, with the latter forming Ash Ra Tempel and going on to become the other major proponent of the \"Berlin School\". Second album, Alpha Centauri, saw the addition of long-standing member Christopher Franke replacing Schulze, while Peter Baumann would come aboard for Zeit. Although unissued until the mid-1980s, Green Desert was recorded in 1973. The core of Froese, Franke and Baumann would sign to Virgin Records in 1973, and the subsequent release Phaedra would cement their style for years to come. Understated, droning keyboard and guitar melodies intertwined with ambient washes of reverberating electronic textures, utilizing synthesizers and sequencers, was typical of the TD sound. Compositions were long, melodic, pulsing pieces. Michael Hoenig temporarily replaced Baumann for an Australian tour in 1975. One highlight of the Virgin period was Sorcerer, a soundtrack to the film of the same name. After Baumann's departure in 1978, TD experimented with the formula on Cyclone, which saw the addition of Steve Jolliffe, adding vocals and woodwinds and Klaus Krüger on drums. Force Majeure was the classic of this period. Johannes Schmölling would join for Tangram. This line-up remained stable until the mid-1980s, as the group shifted toward more rhythmic textures. The increased emphasis on sequencers and rhythm in the first half of the 1980s divided fans, as did subsequent releases which veered heavily into relatively accessible, uplifting melodies.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stint with Jive Records from 1984 to 1988, TD signed to Baumann's Private Music label and then the equally New Agey Miramar, fully embracing digital textures and seeking to distance the group from its moody, psychedelic past. Paul Haslinger replaced Schmölling in 1985, and was in turn replaced by Froese's son Jerome Froese in 1990. Franke left in 1987 over creative differences with Froese. After a mid-1990s move to Edgar Froese's own TDI Music label (later renamed Eastgate), TD's reputation as a New Age band became less appropriate—father and son experimented with more modern sounds and revisited elements of past glories—but the group's artistic direction remained fairly entrenched in melodic pop-rock territory, with an increased use of acoustic instruments, particularly on stage. With Edgar Froese's death in 2015, the band continues, but with none of its original members.","nameVariations":["T. Dream","T.

After much unsigned work under some aliases, the CCO label saw fit to release his debut mini-album, \"Far Away Trains Passing By\". The album became a critical hit and gained more and more listeners through the next couple years as it seeped into the far East and America. Due to strong word-of-mouth and a devoted following, his follow-up album, \"A Strangely Isolated Place\", was an even bigger hit. He has also started branching out with collaborations and remixes with Longview, Mojave 3, I'm Not A Gun, Justin Robertson, The Zephyrs, and more.\r\n\r\n2014-2020, Schnauss was a member of Tangerine Dream, and he debuted with the \"Cupdisc\" (ie.

The cathartic \"Creep\", from the debut album \"Pablo Honey\" (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves. \r\n\r\nRadiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, \"The Bends\" (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man Thom Yorke's expressive singing. The album featured the hits \"High & Dry\", \"Just\" and \"Fake Plastic Trees\". \r\n\r\nThe band's third album, \"OK Computer\" (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990's, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. \"Kid A\" (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.\r\n\r\n\"Hail To The Thief\" (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released \"In Rainbows\" (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album,  \"A Moon Shaped Pool\", was released in May 2016.\r\n \r\nRadiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like The Smiths, Pixies, Magazine, Joy Division and Siouxsie & The Banshees, who Thom Yorke claims inspired him to become a performer, and R.E.M. (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, referring to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').","nameVariations":["Radio Head","Radioheads","レディオヘッド","电台司令"],"aliases":[{"alias_id":449561,"name":"TV Feet"},{"alias_id":840842,"name":"On A Friday"},{"alias_id":1506477,"name":"Shindig (2)"}],"memberInGroups":null,"referenceUrls":["https://www.radiohead.com/","https://radiohead.bandcamp.com/","https://www.facebook.com/radiohead","https://www.instagram.com/radiohead","https://myspace.com/radiohead","https://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1492","https://twitter.com/radiohead","https://www.whosampled.com/Radiohead/","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead","https://www.youtube.com/user/radiohead"]},

The band were joined in 1985 by drummer Steve Shelley, and recorded 15 albums together, as well as many side and solo projects. Their work has been consistently challenging and innovative, and they are widely regarded as one of the most intriguing and influential bands of their time. This view has been added to by the strength of their record \"Sonic Nurse\", which also featured the talents of Jim O'Rourke.  O'Rourke left the band in 2005.  In 2006, Mark Ibold joined the group.\r\n\r\nIn September 2011, Sonic Youth went on \"indefinite hiatus\" following the separation of Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore (the couple had been married since 1984).\r\n\r\nFirst group studio was Echo Canyon in New York City, after that Echo Canyon West located in Hoboken, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nFinal lineup:\r\nKim Gordon - vocals, bass, guitar (1981-2011)\r\nThurston Moore - vocals, guitar (1981-2011)\r\nLee Ranaldo - guitar, vocals (1981-2011), keyboards (2002-2011)\r\nSteve Shelley - drums (1985-2011)\r\nMark Ibold - bass, guitar (2006-2011)\r\n\r\nFormer members:\r\nAnne DeMarinis - keyboards (1981-1982)\r\nRichard Edson - drums (1981-1982)\r\nBob Bert - drums (1982, 1983-1985)\r\nJim Sclavunos - drums (1982-1983)\r\nJim O'Rourke - bass, guitar, synthesizer (1999-2005)","nameVariations":["Chronic Youth","S.Y.","SY","Sonic","Sonic Youth & Guests","Sonic Youth Etc.","Sonic Юность","Sonic-Youth","Sonicyouth","Sonik-Youth","The Sonic Youth","The Sonic-Youth","The Sonik-Youth","Youth","sonicyouth","ソニック・ユース"],"aliases":[{"alias_id":55966,"name":"Ciccone Youth"},{"alias_id":230202,"name":"Sonic Youth With Friends"},{"alias_id":679214,"name":"Sonic Death"}],"memberInGroups":null,"referenceUrls":["http://www.sonicyouth.com","http://sonicyouth.bandcamp.com","http://sonicyoutharchive.bandcamp.com","http://www.facebook.com/sonicyouth","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1019247","http://www.instagram.com/sonicyouth_official","http://www.luxnet.at/sonic-youth/homepage.html","http://myspace.com/sonicyouth","http://www.saucerlike.com","http://www.scaruffi.com/vol4/sonicyou.html","http://twitter.com/thesonicyouth","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Youth","http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOWV89Ww70Uw4Jr8Rmc1GBA"]},

The band released five studio albums, earned six Grammy Awards and two Brits, and was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.\r\nOne of the early bands Sumner played with was The Phoenix Jazzmen. He once performed wearing a black and yellow jersey with hooped stripes that bandleader Gordon Solomon had noted made him look like a bumblebee; thus Sumner became \"Sting\". He uses Sting almost exclusively, except on official documents. In a press conference, he once jokingly stated that even his children call him Sting.\r\nIn 1988, he established PANGÆA.\r\nAs one of the world's most distinctive solo artists, Sting has received an additional 11 Grammy Awards, two Brits, a Golden Globe, an Emmy, four Oscar nominations (most recently for “The Empty Chair” from JIM: The James Foley Story), a TONY nomination, Billboard Magazine's Century Award, and MusiCares 2004 Person of the Year. In 2002, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors and was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2003, Sting received a CBE from Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for services to music. In December 2014 he received the Kennedy Center Honors, and most recently was given The American Music Award of Merit. Throughout his enduring career, he has sold close to 100 million albums from his combined work with The Police and as a solo artist.\r\nSting's support for human rights organizations such as the Rainforest Fund, Amnesty International and Live Aid mirrors his art in its universal outreach.  Along with wife Trudie Styler, Sting founded the Rainforest Fund in 1989 to protect both the world's rainforests and the indigenous people living there. Together they have held 17 benefit concerts to raise funds and awareness for our planet's endangered resources.\r\nReceived the Polar Music Prize 2017.\r\nIn 2019, Sting was honoured at the BMI Pop Awards for his enduring hit single “Every Breath You Take,” which has become the most performed song, with 15 million radio plays, from BMI's catalog of over 14 million musical works.\r\nIn May 2023, he was made an Ivor Novello Fellow.\r\nSting married actress Frances Tomelty from Northern Ireland, on 1 May 1976. Before they divorced in 1984, they had two children: Joseph (\"Joe Sumner\") (born 23 November 1976) and Fuchsia Katherine (\"Kate Sumner\", born 17 April 1982). In 1982, after the birth of his second child, he separated from Tomelty and began living with actress and film producer Trudie Styler. The couple married at Camden Register Office on 20 August 1992. Sting and Styler have four children: Brigitte Michael Michael Sumner (\"Mickey\", born 19 January 1984), Jake Sumner (24 May 1985), Eliot Pauline Eliot Sumner (nicknamed \"Coco\", 30 July 1990), and Giacomo Luke (17 December 1995).\r\n\r\nPreviously worked as a labourer, tax officer, bus conductor & a teacher.","nameVariations":["Gordon Sumner","Siting (Dub 94)","Sting (The Police)","Sting [Gordon Sumner]","Sting/Virgin","Sting: Gordon M Sumner","Stings","Stiug","Sumner","The Sting","Стинг","סטינג","スティング","史汀","斯汀","스팅","스팅의"],"aliases":[{"alias_id":207403,"name":"Gordon Sumner"}],"memberInGroups":null,"referenceUrls":["https://www.Sting.com/","https://www.Facebook.com/sting","https://Twitter.com/OfficialSting","https://www.Instagram.com/theofficialsting/","https://www.YouTube.com/user/StingVEVO","https://www.TikTok.com/@official_sting/","https://www.facebook.com/thepolice","https://www.thepolice.com","https://twitter.com/thepoliceband","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician)","https://soundcloud.com/sting","https://www.last.fm/music/Sting","https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001776/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1","https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=sting","https://equipboard.com/pros/sting","https://musicianbio.org/sting/","https://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003606/Sting.html","https://www.biography.com/musician/sting","https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/sting.html","https://www.geni.com/people/Sting/6000000030367840163","https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Sting"]},
